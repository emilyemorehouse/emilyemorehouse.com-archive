I usually like to start by meeting in person for, say, coffee or tea to get to know each other. From there, it really depends on what you’re looking for and what can help you grow and succeed. Sometimes that’s doing code reviews or helping guide you if you get stuck on a problem, sometimes it’s picking my brain about a piece of tech I’ve worked with, or sometimes it’s just being there to bounce ideas off of or kickstart networking in town.
