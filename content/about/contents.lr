<p>
    I'm currently working in Tallahassee as part of <a href="http://www.cuttlesoft.com">Cuttlesoft</a>, a software development company focused on early-stage prototypes for startups.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated in the summer of 2014 from Florida State University with degrees in theatre, criminology and computer science as well as minoring in mathematics and psychology (yeah, I was a little busy).
</p>
<p>
    I'm interested in pursuing further research in the realm of programming language theory, particularly formal verification and parallelization, as well as application development with OSS.
